First off, I would like to clarify that at this point in time an animation controller is NOT included in this package.

The animation clips are imported in the model's FBX file. There is NOT a folder anywhere within the "LowPoly_Horse" package folder containing separate animation files. Select "LowPoly_Horse/Horse3D_Opt_Ver4.fbx" and select the "Animation" tab in the "Inspector" window to preview the animations and view their properties.

I hope you enjoy this package, and if you have any questions or concerns please feel free to email me at:
