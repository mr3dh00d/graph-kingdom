Version 2.9 Important Information:

Materials:
Body Materials for Version 2.9 are located in LPHorse_Version_2_9/Version_2_31/Horse3D/Materials.

Note: The Mane material can no longer be assigned separately from the main body.

Animations:
As of this point in time a animation controller is not included in this package, but the layer masks are included.
A basic knowledge of Animation Controllers is highly recommended in order to get the most out of this package.

Animations listed as Primary should be used in the base layer of the animation controller.
Additive listed animations should be layered as additive in the animation controller.
Override listed animations should be layered as Override in the animation controller.
Not all Additive/Override animations are compatible with every primary animation. Be aware of possible clipping and undesired effects when using additive/override animations.
Primary Action animations should generally not be used with additive/override animations.
